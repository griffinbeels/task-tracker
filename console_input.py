"""Type text into another process's console window, the way a keyboard would.

Claude Code has no flag that pre-fills its prompt box. A positional prompt is
*submitted* the instant the session opens, and there is nothing in between — so
the only way to hand a fresh session text it has not yet sent is to deliver it
as console input. Windows allows exactly that: attach to another process's
console and write into its input buffer.

Four things this module has to get right, each learned by watching a real
session receive the text:

* **Bracketed paste.** The text is wrapped in the markers a terminal emits for
  Ctrl+V (`ESC [ 200 ~` … `ESC [ 201 ~`). Without them a newline mid-text reads
  as Enter and submits the first task on its own.
* **Wait for the prompt box.** Input written earlier is not lost — it queues in
  the console input buffer — but it can be *consumed by whatever is on screen
  first*. A folder Claude has not been trusted in opens on "Is this a project
  you trust?", whose default answer is Enter. So poll until the session's
  status hint proves the prompt box is up, and only then type.
* **Wait between every write, for the screen and not for the clock.** Two
  writes the session reads in one go are not two events to it. Measured
  against a live session: writing the whole hand-off back to back put
  `/rename …` and `/color green` on one line with *both* Enters discarded — a
  `\r` between two bracketed pastes is read as part of the paste. The gap that
  matters is not how long the writer waited, it is whether the session has
  drained the buffer, and the prompt box is where that shows.
* **Give up quietly.** Every caller has already put the same text on the
  clipboard, so a timeout costs one Ctrl+V, never the text itself.
* **A slash command must be submitted; the task text must not be.** A `/rename`
  or `/color` line is dead unless Enter follows it, but the prompt it hands off
  to is meant to sit there for the user to edit — so `deliver` submits every
  command first and pastes the prompt last. A failed command then costs only
  itself: the prompt still arrives, because it was never made to depend on the
  commands succeeding.

The calling process must not own a console it still needs: attaching to another
console means leaving your own, and there is no way back. The tracker runs
under `pythonw.exe`, which has no console at all.

    Bracketed for the same reason `paste` is bracketed, but for the opposite
    danger: a leading "/" opens Claude Code's command-suggestion popup, a live
    UI that reads keystrokes as they arrive. A raw Enter sent right after raw
    characters risks the popup reading it as "accept the highlighted
    suggestion" rather than "submit what I typed". A paste arrives as one
    event carrying the whole line, so the popup never sees a partial token and
    has nothing to select — only then is the Enter, a separate write, safe to
    send.

    The Enter is not sent until the line is *visible in the prompt box*, and
    the call is not finished until it has left again. Both waits are the fix
    for one measured failure: written back to back, the line and its Enter
    queue in the console input buffer, and a session that reads them in a
    single pass treats a `\\r` sitting between two bracketed pastes as part of
    the paste. The commands then merge onto one line — `/rename …/color green`
    — with both Enters silently discarded, and the task prose lands on the end
    of that same line. Seeing the box change is the only proof the session
    read one write before the next one arrives; a `time.sleep` is not, because
    it measures the writer rather than the reader.

    An empty line is nothing to submit: writing empty paste markers and then
    pressing Enter would send a blank prompt to the session. `setup_commands`
    never produces one, but this and `paste` are read as a pair and refuse an
    empty argument the same way.

    regardless. Only the first wait is for a process that has not booted yet
