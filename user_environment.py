"""The environment a freshly-launched process of yours gets, rebuilt from Windows.

A session handed off by the tracker has to be indistinguishable from one you
opened by hand: cd to the project, open a terminal, run claude. It was not.
The tracker is normally started *from* a Claude session, and Claude Code sets
a batch of variables for the processes it spawns — `NO_COLOR=1`, `GIT_EDITOR`,
`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION`, and more. Popen inherits
the tracker's environment, so every one of those was handed straight on: the
new session rendered monochrome, its git could not open an editor or ask for
credentials, and it kept no transcript.

Filtering the inherited environment cannot fix this, only chase it. The list
is upstream's and it grows. So don't filter — rebuild. `CreateEnvironmentBlock`
is what Windows itself uses to build the environment for a newly launched
process, straight from the machine and per-user registry, and it knows nothing
about whatever started the tracker. Reconstructing beats subtracting: a
variable added upstream tomorrow is absent by construction rather than by a
denylist nobody remembered to update.
