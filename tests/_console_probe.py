"""Two halves of the console-typing test, kept out of the pytest process.

`paste` attaches this process to someone else's console, which means leaving
its own — pytest's terminal would go with it. Running both halves here keeps
that where it belongs: in a throwaway process.

  child   prints a fake "ready" prompt, then logs every character it reads
  parent  opens the child in a new console, types into it, prints the log

# buffer all behave exactly as they do for a visible one — it just never shows
# the host window, which is the whole of what this test needs.

# It used to be CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE plus launcher.unfocused_startup(), on the
# theory that SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE made the window harmless. It does not, because
# Windows 11 delegates new consoles to whatever is set as the default terminal
# application. When that is Windows Terminal, WT creates the window itself and
# the spawner's STARTUPINFO never reaches it: a full Terminal window opens,
# activated, for as long as the child lives. Measured 2026-07-25 — every run of
# this suite flashed one, which is most of what "random windows keep popping up
# while Claude works" turned out to be.
